 In the spirit of Solana, transparency and our dedication to the betterment of the ecosystem.  We are open sourcing a bunch of our code!  This will include helpful scripts, web apps, servers, programs etc that we use or will use in the future.

Not everything will be shared and the process will be slow to ensure that we are sharing quality code with as helpful comments as we can provide!

We hope this helps projects and developers in the Solana ecosystem and we look forward to seeing what you all build!

We will be open sourcing this code under the MIT License. There is no need for attribution, though any is welcome!

If this has helped you and would like to support us, please consider purchasing a TombStoned NFT!

THIS IS ALL A WORK IN PROGRESS WHILE I HAVE TIME AND THUS NOT COMPLETE. THERE ARE WORKING PARTS OF THE CLI BUT A LOT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED FULLY. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. I WILL BE UPDATING THIS AS I HAVE TIME. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HELP PLEASE REACH OUT TO ME ON DISCORD. THANKS!
